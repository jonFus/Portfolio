		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I've started my Engineering carrear with breacking alot of stuff, from CD players to bicycles. To my defence I was in elementry school.</p>
		<p>With time I became better and better at building part, insted of breacking part.</p><p>Today with over 10 years of experience as a senior engineer and project manager I know how to build, on time and on budget, complex multidiciplinary products.</p>
		<p>I've lead a team of electrical, mechanical, software, and industrial design developers to build groundbracking and inovative consumer products, from a MRD to DFM and full production.</p>
