		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I've started my Engineering career with breaking a lot of stuff, from CD players to bicycles. In my defense I was in elementary school.</p>
		<p>With time I became better and better at the building part, instead of the breaking part.</p><p>Today with over 10 years of experience as a senior engineer and project manager I know how to build innovative, complex multidisciplinary products, on time and on budget.<p>I've lead a team of Electrical, Mechanical, Software, and Industrial design developers to build groundbreaking and butiful consumer products, from a MRD to DFM and full production.</p>
		<p>This is what I always wanted to do. <b>To be an inventor</b></p>
